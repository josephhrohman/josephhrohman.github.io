        the oil can guitars, like the cigarbox guitars, have always facinated me for their rougher, mountain-rock & roll style and persona.
        <br/><br/>
        i needed a design challenge though so i set out to not only create a guitar and close relative the banjo - but what happens when you use an oil can as the resonator for... a uke, mandolin, or strumstick?

        starting with the banjo, i needed to plan out how i was going to attach the neck to the oil cans in such a way to balance the structual integrity of the instrument with the avoiding inhibiting the sound.
        <br/><br/>
        the simple answer was essentially - make it a stick and bolt it in from the bottom.  plus - this gives me more than enough room to throw a piezo-pickup in the oil can.

        the next easy part of most of these instruments is making templates for the neck and fretboard shapes.
        <br/><br/>
        here i've laid out the different templates i made in order to adequately size the oil can resonators to buy.

        fretting is by far the most difficult part of building any instruments with frets.  i've read that a trained musician can supposedly hear a difference in fret location by 1/64".
        <br/><br/>
        So great - these frets have to be perfect and i get a spreadsheet with locations like 30.8435". this is where my fraction parser app is insanely useful.

        gluing down the fretboard, now cut with every fret-slot needed, i can position the neck and fretboard perfectly for the scale length of the instrument.
        <br/><br/>
        i now get to marvle at the fact that i'm making a banjo from what i expect an oil can banjo to look like and reseraching almost nothing else outside of where does that high string end mid-way on the neck.

        in the spirit of the oil can nature of the instrument line i'm making, i decided to use a bolt head for the fret markers on the neck. threads were cut off, and the head was inset into the fretboard.
        <br/><br/>
        the frets were next so i could sand everything perfectly flat before having to level the frets.

        my first prototype was completely hand made.  while all the buttons, screens, raspberry pi - everything worked apart from one rather crucial aspect...
        <br/><br/>
        i did not correctly account for the space i'd need for the wires and the guts wouldn't fit inside the case.

        i learned a lot from that prototype- i re-thought the size of the buttons and investigated the rest of the parts: screen and driverboard, power converter, digital-to-audio-converter, headphone jack, graceful-shutdown circuit to save the raspberry pi, etc.
        <br/><br/>
        most importantly - creating my own copper-trace breadboard do do away with all these wires.  both reducing the overall size of the console and making it more efficient in design.

        all of this planning really relied on my ability to accuratly produce what i had designed.
        <br/><br/>
        thus enters my plunge into the world of CNCs.  i chose a cnc over a 3D-printer because the subtractive process gave me a larger choice of materials.  i wanted this thing in atomic purple if it was going to break the bank.

        by this time i had to part ways with the project but left it in a good place i believe.
        <br/><br/>
        i need to setup and calibrate my cnc, begin etching the circuit pattern into the copper clad board i have, and finally finish these devices.
