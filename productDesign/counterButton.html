        the company i worked for designed and produced over 25 makeup brand booths at a convention and one of them decided they wanted a button for people to press as they enter the booth and a number on a screen would increment.
        <br/><br/>
        i take on the project having absolutely no experience coding and started by hacking apart a cheap bluetooth keyboard.  i knew that, in theory, i needed a receiver otherwise we'd have an ugly, 15' wire to deal with.

        being in the event industry - you look for items that are already built and salvage them for parts.  it's much faster this way.
        <br/><br/>
        in this case, i took a staples easy button because of it's size, shape, and function and put my new circuit inside of it.

        inspecting the circuit in the cheap bluetooth keyboard i quickly realized that every key on the keyboard was actually connected by the same, partially broken, conductive trace.
        <br/><br/>
        because of this, i devised a theory that maybe the logic of the board is set to read different resistances as different keys on the board.
        <br/><br/>
        to my suprise, that's exactly what was going on and by carfully soldering some leads on the board, i was able to print out '000000' on screen.

        i could rely on two loose wires touching each other when someone hits the button - so i further salvage a conductive pad and trace from an old usb game controller.
        <br/><br/>
        this was a really useful step because the button cap was so tall, i could slowly sand it down to adjust for the throw of the button. that way i could guarantee the button press would work every time.
